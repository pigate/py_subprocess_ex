Using python's subprocess module,
we study interprocess communication.

First, we will have a main process fork a subprocess.
This subprocess loops some task, and after a specified time,
the main process will signal the subprocess to stop.
On receiving the stop sig, the subprocess will gracefully terminate and exit.

$ python run.py
